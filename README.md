# The-Inventory-management-Project
This is a project of two phases: The first phase requires using SQL Server Management Studio to design a database for inventory management. The second phase requires writing Python codes to query, populate and display the inventory management database. Below is a simple breakdown of the tasks done.


Inventory Management Application 
	Database: SQL Server Management Studio
	Backend Programming language: Python
•	Requirements Analysis: I identified the requirements for inventory tracking. I listed out the entities like products, suppliers, and transactions.
•	Database Schema Design: I created a relational database schema. I defined tables, relationships, and constraints.
•	SQL Implementation: I wrote SQL scripts to create the database and tables. I included triggers or stored procedures for transaction updates.
•	Functional Implementation:  I developed SQL queries for adding new products, updating stock levels, and generating reports and ensured data accuracy during stock transactions.
•	User Interface Integration: I integrated the SQL database with a simple user interface using Python scripting language.
•	End-to-end functionality testing.
